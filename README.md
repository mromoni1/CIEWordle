Combined with the Ladder Game, this is the my first project I created using object-oriented design. I challenged myself with creating a 
near-identical implementation of Wordle using Java and JavaSwing. Although graphics in Java definitely have their limits, I found a way 
to create the game. 

This project was written in Java during Summer 2022.
